# Legal-Sales-Target-App
This project aims to help Clio's sales and marketing by offering a specialized, client-focused tool to discover potential clients, gain valuable insights about them, and effectively promote Clio.

The web application features an intuitive, map-based interface that allows users to easily explore and target law firms either in their vicinity or within any specific region of interest. Once a firm is selected, the app uses AI to summarize firm websites and give users all the information they need to know about the place. The good thing about this is that it doesn't have to be law firms! This app can be catered towards any business type (ex: doctors, parks, attractions, etc.) and it will always provide users with real-time data.

### The app also goes a step further by:
- Assessing the probability that a particular law firm will become a Clio client.
- Creating customized messages that highlight how Clioâ€™s software and services can support the specific needs of the law firm, considering their practice areas and operational style.
- Developing promotional content and tailored pitches/proposals for each law firm.
- Sending templated or AI-generated emails to the selected law firm to promote Clio or notify them of any updates

## Running the app
